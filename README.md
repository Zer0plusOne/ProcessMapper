# Process Mapper

This project aims to visualize the operating system processes using Python and several graphical libraries. It allows users to see the relationship between processes and obtain information about resource consumption.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `matplotlib`: for graphical visualization.
- `networkx`: for creating graphs that represent processes.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zer0plusOne/ProcessMapper/
   cd ProcessMapper
   ```

2. Run the dependency installation script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x Dependencies_install.sh
   ./Dependencies_install.sh
   ```

This script will update the package index and ensure that `pip` is installed. Then, it will install `matplotlib` and `networkx`.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main script of the project with:

```bash
python3 ProcessMapper.py
```
